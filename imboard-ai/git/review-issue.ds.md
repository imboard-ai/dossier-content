# Review Issue — Parallel Code Review

## Objective

Run a tier-appropriate set of focused review agents in parallel on the branch diff. Each agent reviews from a different quality dimension and **reports** findings — it does not edit. After all agents complete, this phase dedupes their findings and applies the fixes itself, serially, then re-runs tests and lint once.

## Prerequisites

- You are in the correct worktree/directory for this issue
- The branch has changes to review (`git diff <base_branch>...HEAD --name-only`, plus any uncommitted `git diff --name-only`)
- The codebase builds and tests pass before this phase begins

## Actions to Perform

### Step 1: Confirm Working Directory

Run `pwd` to confirm you are in the worktree. If not, `cd` back into it.

### Step 2: Get Changed Files

```bash
git diff --name-only
```

Review the FULL branch diff: `git diff <base_branch>...HEAD --name-only` plus any uncommitted `git diff --name-only` (by protocol implement already synced to origin, so the tree is typically clean — an empty uncommitted diff alone means nothing). Only if BOTH are empty: stop and report "No changes to review."

### Step 2b: Fetch Acceptance Criteria (for Agent 7)

```bash
gh issue view <issue_number> --json comments \
  --jq '[.comments[].body | select(startswith("<!-- runstate:v1 -->") and (contains("phase=plan")))] | last // empty'
```

Parse the `ac<n>=` lines from that milestone (written verbatim, spaces included — see plan-issue's runstate milestone; match case-insensitively, since milestones from runs before CLI 0.10.0 wrote `AC<n>=`). This is the Acceptance Criteria list Agent 7 verifies against. If no such milestone exists or it has zero `ac<n>=` lines (e.g. a refactor/infra issue where plan-issue judged AC not applicable), skip Agent 7 entirely and report `ac_total=0`.

### Step 2c: Select the Review Agents (risk floor, then relevance)

Not every diff earns seven agents — and not every dimension applies to every diff. Two stages, from `git diff <base_branch>... --stat` plus Step 2's changed-file list:

**Stage 1 — risk floor.** Any changed path touching a sensitive area (auth, payment/billing, migrations, `.github/**`, security, crypto, secrets, infra/terraform) → tier `full`, **all 7 agents**, regardless of size. Stop here.

**Stage 2 — relevance selection.** Otherwise, Conformance ALWAYS runs (it is the trust anchor; it drops out only when Step 2b found no AC list), and each other agent runs only if its trigger fires:

| Agent | Runs only if the diff… |
|---|---|
| Documentation | touches `*.md`/`docs/`, a README'd surface, or changes public/user-visible behavior |
| Security | touches input handling, subprocess/shell execution, network calls, auth, secrets, deps/lockfiles |
| DRY | adds > 30 lines of code |
| Maintainability | changes > 30 lines or > 2 files of code |
| Supportability | touches error paths, logging, retries, or adds an operation someone will run/debug |
| Convention/Contract | changes a public API, schema, CLI flag, or cross-package contract |

Name the tier by the resulting set: **micro** (Conformance only — typical for a ≤20-line single-file tweak with no triggers), **docs** (Conformance + Documentation), **small** (2–3 agents), **full** (all 7). A trigger you are unsure about fires — uncertainty selects the agent, it never deselects it.

State the selection and why in one line before launching, e.g. `Tier: micro (1 file, 9 lines, shell — security trigger fired? no: no input/exec change) — running conformance only`. `agents_done`/`agents_pending` list only the selected agents; the milestone carries `tier=micro|docs|small|full`.

### Step 2d: Duration Sanity Floor

A review that finishes implausibly fast was not performed: full tier < 5 minutes, small tier < 2 minutes (docs and micro tiers have no floor). If the floor is violated, the review is INVALID regardless of its findings — redo the review once at the strongest available tier; record `review_redone=true` in the milestone. (imboard#3692)

### Step 3: Run the Tier's Review Agents in Parallel

Launch the tier's agents simultaneously using the Agent tool, each receiving the changed-files list and operating independently. Agents outside the tier do not run at all — do not launch them "just in case". **All review agents are report-only**: they return findings and never touch the working tree; Step 4 applies the fixes.

---

#### Classification Criteria (applies to ALL review agents)

Every review agent must classify each finding as follows:

- **Fix now** (default): the finding this phase will apply in Step 4. Bugs, wrong text, missing
  validation, bad names, missing error handling, code duplication, doc inaccuracies, type
  improvements, refactoring — all of them. If you can write the fix, it is "Fix now"; write it
  into the finding as the proposed fix rather than editing the file. No exceptions for severity
  or scope — minor and major findings alike get applied.
- **Escalate**: ONLY for findings where ALL three of these are true:
  (a) The fix would change user-facing behavior or public API semantics
  (b) You cannot fully verify the fix with existing tests
  (c) It requires a product/business decision (e.g., "should we deprecate this?",
      "is this a breaking change we accept?")
  If any of (a), (b), (c) is false, it is "Fix now", not "Escalate".

**Never escalate**: code quality, documentation gaps, refactoring suggestions, type
improvements, minor bugs, "consider doing X" opinions. Report them as "Fix now" or skip them.

> Most PRs should have zero escalated issues. If you are escalating more than 2 total across all agents, re-evaluate each finding against the three-part test.

> **What escalating costs**: an escalated finding does not spin off a side issue — it stops the entire full-cycle run and hands the original issue back to a human as `decision-pending` (see full-cycle-issue's Guiding Principle). That cost is why the three-part test is strict.

#### Reporting contract (appended to EVERY agent prompt below)

> **Report only — do NOT edit any file.** Return a findings list; one entry per finding:
> `file:line`, what is wrong, the proposed fix (concrete enough to apply), and the
> Fix-now/Escalate classification per the Classification Criteria above.
> If none found, report "No <DRY violations | security issues | supportability issues | maintainability issues | documentation issues | documented conventions to enforce> found." (Agent 7 returns the per-AC verdict list instead.)

---

#### Agent 1: DRY Review

> Review the branch changes for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) violations — AI agents frequently rewrite code that already exists in the codebase. For each changed file:
> 1. Read the file fully
> 2. Search the **entire codebase** for existing functions, utilities, or patterns that do the same thing
> 3. Flag duplicated logic (>5 similar lines), reimplemented helpers, or missed utility reuse
> 4. Check if anything was reimplemented that is available in project dependencies
>
> [+ Reporting contract]

#### Agent 2: Security Review

> Review the uncommitted changes for security vulnerabilities. Check every changed file for:
> - Injection (SQL, command, template, path traversal)
> - XSS (unescaped user input in HTML/JSX/templates)
> - Auth/authz gaps
> - Hardcoded secrets, API keys, tokens
> - Insecure patterns, unsafe deserialization
> - Missing input validation at system boundaries
> - OWASP Top 10
>
> [+ Reporting contract]

#### Agent 3: Supportability Review

> Review the uncommitted changes for supportability — can someone debug and operate this code in production? Check every changed file for:
> - Error messages: Are they actionable? Do they include context (what failed, what was expected)?
> - Logging: Are key operations logged? Can you trace a request through the system?
> - Error handling: Are errors caught with useful context, or do they bubble as cryptic stack traces?
> - Failure modes: What happens when external calls fail? Is there graceful degradation?
>
> [+ Reporting contract]

#### Agent 4: Maintainability Review

> Review the uncommitted changes for maintainability — will the next developer understand and safely modify this code? Check every changed file for:
> - Unclear or misleading names
> - Functions >50 lines or deeply nested (>3 levels)
> - Magic numbers/strings without named constants
> - Tight coupling that blocks testing or reuse
> - Missing TypeScript types (any, implicit any)
> - Dead code, unused imports, unreachable branches
> - Leftover console.log / debugger statements
> - TODO/FIXME/HACK without issue references
>
> [+ Reporting contract]

#### Agent 5: Documentation Review

> Review the uncommitted changes for documentation gaps and inaccuracies. Check:
> 1. **README**: Does it still accurately describe the project? Are new features/commands/options documented?
> 2. **Doc files** (docs/, *.md): Are any now outdated or incorrect because of the code changes?
> 3. **Code comments**: Are existing comments still accurate? Are complex new sections missing explanations?
> 4. **API surface**: If public APIs changed, are type definitions / JSDoc / OpenAPI specs updated?
> 5. **Examples**: Do code examples in docs still work?
>
> [+ Reporting contract]

#### Agent 6: Convention / Contract Enforcement

> Review the uncommitted changes for violations of the project's cross-cutting contracts and conventions — the rules that are easy to break from memory and that a generic linter will not catch. Enforce them on the touched code.
>
> 1. Read the project's convention sources: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and anything under `docs/architecture/` or `docs/conventions/`.
> 2. For each changed file, check it against those documented contracts. Common classes: API request/response envelopes consumed through the shared helper (not ad-hoc destructuring of response bodies); data-access conventions (where indexes are declared, reference-field shape); shared error/response wrappers; module-boundary and naming rules the project documents.
> 3. Flag any touched code that bypasses a documented contract, citing the convention source (file + rule).
> 4. **New backend route without an integration test.** If the diff added or modified a route under `packages/backend/src/api/v1/registry/routes/`, run the route-coverage mapper (`pnpm --filter imboard_be test:route-coverage`) and check whether any route in the diff is reported as uncovered. A new uncovered route is a contract violation — this is an agents-driven repo, so an agent-authored route MUST land with its integration test, not a human-authored follow-up. Flag it as a finding. (If this project has no such routes/mapper, skip this check.)
>
> A contract violation is verifiable and is not a product decision — classify it "Fix now" per the Classification Criteria (for an uncovered route, the proposed fix is the integration test under `tests/integration/`). If the project documents no such conventions, report "No documented conventions to enforce."
>
> [+ Reporting contract]

#### Agent 7: Conformance (blind)

Run this agent on the strongest available model — it is the run's trust anchor.

> You are verifying that the change does what the issue asked. You did NOT write this code. Your ONLY inputs are: (1) the issue body and comments — `gh issue view <N> --json title,body,comments`; (2) the diff — `git diff <base_branch>...HEAD` plus `git diff` for uncommitted changes; (3) this Acceptance Criteria list: <paste the `ac<n>=` lines fetched in Step 2b>. Do NOT read the planning document or any other agent's output.
>
> For each AC report exactly one of: `met <file:line>`, `not-met <why>`, `unverifiable <what test would prove it>`. `met` without a file:line citation is invalid — report it as `unverifiable`.
>
> **Report only — do NOT edit any file.** Return the per-AC verdict list; Step 4 acts on it.

### Step 4: After All Agents Complete — Dedupe, Then Apply Serially

The agents reported; you apply. **You are the only writer in this worktree** — parallel writers produce duplicate helpers that ship uncalled (ai-dossier#447).

1. **Collect** every finding from the tier's agents into one list.
2. **Dedupe** before touching anything:
   - Same `file:line`, or the same root cause reported from two angles → ONE finding.
   - Two agents proposing different fixes for one problem → pick the better fix, apply only that one, and note in the summary which was chosen and why.
   - A finding whose proposed fix is already implied by another finding's fix → drop it.
3. **Apply all "Fix now" findings yourself, serially** — one at a time, with the Edit tool, in the deduped list's order; these can be non-trivial (refactors, error handling, historic lint issues in touched files). Do not re-dispatch an agent to apply its own finding.
4. **Route Agent 7's conformance results**:
   - Any `not-met` → return to implement for ONE bounded fix loop scoped to that AC, then re-run Agent 7 ONLY (not the other 6). A second `not-met` on the same AC after that fix loop → escalate (counts toward `review_escalated`, reason "spec not met after one fix loop").
   - `unverifiable` → add the test Agent 7 named, then mark the AC met.
5. **Re-run tests ONCE**, after all fixes are applied — not per fix. If a fix breaks tests, revert that specific fix and reclassify as Escalate, then re-run.
6. **Run the lint auto-fixer ONCE**, after the tests pass — biome: `npx biome check --write .`; eslint: `npx eslint --fix .`; ruff: `ruff check --fix .`; or the project's own `lint:fix` script (check package.json / Makefile).
7. **Sync to origin** (WIP sync rule — see full-cycle-issue's Runstate Milestones): if there are changes (`git status --porcelain` non-empty), `git add -A && git commit -m "wip(review): apply review fixes [skip ci]" && git push`. Do this whether the phase is about to post `status=done` or `status=partial` — push before posting the milestone either way.

### Step 5: Output

Report the review results:

```
Review complete.
Tier: <docs|small|full> — <one-line reason>
Fixed: <count> deduped findings from <agent_count> agents
Escalated: <count> findings (see details below)
Clean: <list of agents with no findings>

Acceptance Criteria: <ac_met>/<ac_total> met
- AC1 <criterion> — met <file:line> | not-met <why> | unverifiable <what test would prove it>
- AC2 <criterion> — met <file:line> | not-met <why> | unverifiable <what test would prove it>

[If escalated items exist:]
Escalated findings:
- [Agent]: <description> — Reason: <why all three escalation criteria apply>
```

### Step 6: Runstate Milestone

Post the phase milestone to the issue. This is the last step of the phase — if review aborts, post `--status blocked --kv reason=<short-slug>` instead and stop. Use `--status partial` when any of the tier's agents did not finish. Comments are append-only: never edit or delete a prior milestone. Do not skip this in nested or fleet mode — it is the only state that survives the session.

```bash
ai-dossier runstate post --issue <issue_number> --phase review --status done --run <run_id> \
  --kv head=<short sha of HEAD> \
  --kv fixed=<n> \
  --kv escalated=<n> \
  --kv tier=docs|small|full \
  --kv agents_done=<comma list of the tier's agents that finished> \
  --kv agents_pending=<comma list or none> \
  --kv ac_met=<n> \
  --kv ac_total=<n> \
  --kv review_redone=<true|false>
```

Let the CLI stamp `at=` and compute `next=ship` — do not pass either; never hand-write the comment. `agents_done`/`agents_pending` cover only the tier's agent set (Step 2c), not all 7. `head=` is the pushed sha from Step 4 item 7 (`git rev-parse --short HEAD` after the push, or current `HEAD` if there was nothing to commit). `review_redone=` is optional — pass it only when Step 2d's duration floor triggered a redo.

## Output

- `review_tier`: `docs` | `small` | `full` — which agent set ran, and why (Step 2c)
- `review_fixed`: number of deduped findings applied
- `review_escalated`: number of findings escalated to the user (ideally 0)
- `review_clean`: list of agent names that found no issues
- `ac_met` / `ac_total`: acceptance criteria met vs. total (0/0 when Agent 7 was skipped — no AC list found)
- `ac_results`: the per-AC checklist (criterion, verdict, file:line or reason) from Agent 7 — pass through to ship-issue for the PR body's Acceptance Criteria section
- Posts runstate milestone to the issue (`phase=review`, including `tier` and `ac_met`/`ac_total`)

## Validation

- [ ] Working directory confirmed; changed files obtained via `git diff --name-only`
- [ ] Acceptance Criteria fetched from the last `phase=plan` milestone (Step 2b) before launching Agent 7
- [ ] Tier computed and stated in one line before launching (Step 2c); any sensitive path forced `full`
- [ ] Duration sanity floor checked (Step 2d): full ≥5 min, small ≥2 min, docs no floor; a violation triggered one redo at the strongest tier with `review_redone=true`
- [ ] Agent 7 (Conformance) ran on the strongest available model
- [ ] Exactly the tier's agents were launched in parallel (Agent 7 skipped only when no AC list was found)
- [ ] Every agent was report-only — no agent edited a file — and classified findings using the Classification Criteria
- [ ] Findings deduped (same file:line / same root cause collapsed; competing fixes resolved to one), then all "Fix now" findings applied serially by this phase via the Edit tool
- [ ] A new/changed backend registry route in the diff was checked against the route-coverage mapper; any uncovered route was flagged (and its integration test added)
- [ ] Every `not-met` AC went through one bounded fix loop + a re-run of Agent 7 alone; a second `not-met` on the same AC was escalated
- [ ] Every `unverifiable` AC got the named test added, then was marked met
- [ ] `met` citations without a `file:line` were treated as `unverifiable`, not accepted
- [ ] Tests re-run once after all fixes (no regressions); lint auto-fixer run once, after the tests passed
- [ ] Escalated findings (if any) each satisfy all three escalation criteria, and no more than 2 were escalated total (re-evaluated if exceeded)
- [ ] Final output includes the tier and counts for fixed, escalated, clean, and `ac_met`/`ac_total`
- [ ] Any changes were committed and pushed to origin (`wip(review): ...`) before the milestone — on `done` and `partial` alike — and milestone `head=` is the pushed sha
- [ ] Runstate milestone was posted via `ai-dossier runstate post`, including `tier=`

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| No uncommitted changes | Verify you are in the correct directory and that implementation completed before running review. |
| Two agents "fixed" the same thing and the codebase now has two helpers | The failure report-only prevents (ai-dossier#447). Agents must not edit; if one did, revert its edits and re-apply from the deduped list yourself. |
| Agent finds issues in files not in the diff | Out of scope — skip unless directly impacted by the changes (e.g. a caller of a changed function). |
| Fix breaks tests | Revert that fix (`git checkout -- <file>`, re-apply the others) and reclassify it as Escalate, explaining the test failure. |
| Too many escalated findings | If more than 2, re-read each against the three-part test. Most findings that feel like escalations are "Fix now" — code quality, naming, missing validation and documentation gaps are always fixed directly. |
| Lint auto-fixer introduces changes | Expected. Skim the auto-fix diff to ensure nothing was mangled, then proceed. |
