# Batch Integrate

## Objective

N members implemented N issues in isolation. You make them one shippable change: merge, verify **once**, repair what is yours to repair, and ship a single PR. The one expensive verification replacing N is the entire economic case for the batch.

**Your defining constraint: everything you act on is second-hand.** You did not write this code. Every decision — did the suite finish, did it pass, whose change broke it, is this infrastructure or code — is an inference from an artifact. Each has an expensive wrong answer.

## Prerequisites

- Every member has pushed its branch and posted a `## handover:v1` comment. **Read them all before you start.** They are your only access to each author's intent, and they name what each member deliberately left unverified — which is exactly the surface you now own.
- The repo declares its verification capabilities. You invoke what the repo declares; you never hardcode a script name.

## Actions to Perform

### Step 1: Merge members onto the integration branch

Merge each member branch in turn. Expect most to be clean.

**When two members conflict, look at whether they are independent.** Members that each anchored an addition to the same structural landmark — the same component, the same registry, the same list — will collide when one of them relocates it, even with disjoint file predictions. Members that are slices of one designed sequence (PR1/PR2/PR3 of a feature) are not independent at all and will conflict by construction.

A conflict is **not** grounds for eviction. Resolve it so every member's intent survives. If resolving requires deciding what a feature *should* do, that is semantic — escalate it (Step 4). If the two features genuinely cannot coexist, say so and name which member to evict and why; do not silently drop one member's work to get a clean merge.

Then bring the base up to date. **A batch that outlives another batch's merge inherits its changes** — on an active repo the base can move by several commits during a single batch's lifetime. Merge the base branch in and resolve; additive collisions in shared constant or registry files are the common case and resolve by union.

### Step 2: Cheap gates first

Run the repo's cheap checks over the combined branch — typecheck, lint/format, and any fast repo-wide guard — **before** paying for the expensive suite.

This ordering is not a nicety. Members' real defects are disproportionately caught here: formatting that fails a shared gate, a repo-wide convention guard, a compile error at a merge seam. Finding one of those *inside* the expensive run costs the whole run.

Repair what these surface (Step 3), then proceed.

### Step 3: Run the expensive verification ONCE, and read its result in four states

Invoke the repo's declared full verification for the combined branch. Then classify the outcome — **four ways, never two:**

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | verification passed | proceed to review and ship |
| `task-failed` | a real defect, with evidence the verification earned | repair (below), then evict on budget exhaustion |
| `automation-broken` | the verification could not stand behind its own answer | **BLOCK. Change nothing. Retry or surface.** |
| `capability-unavailable` | the repo declares no such verification | skip it and say so; never treat absence as a pass |

**The `automation-broken` branch is the one that saves work, and it is not rare.** Shared infrastructure — a test-database pool, a container registry, a runner — is contended by everything else running against it. A contended resource produces failures that look exactly like member regressions: whole suites red, dozens of failing test names, often in a suite whose subject matter matches a member's change.

Distinguish them by cause, not by name. Read the actual error under a failing test. If every failure traces to a connection timeout, a lease failure, a setup helper throwing on a 5xx, or a runner crash — that is `automation-broken`. Zero genuine assertions among many failing test names is the signature.

**Never revert a member's commits on a signal the verification cannot stand behind.** A retry costs minutes; a wrong eviction destroys a member's work and the money that produced it.

### Step 4: Repair what is mechanical, escalate what is semantic

The split is **authority, not difficulty.**

**Yours (mechanical):** formatting, a call-signature or API-shape error, a missing flag, a merge seam, a convention a repo-wide guard names. You have the diff and the trace; that is enough.

**Not yours (semantic):** any question whose answer requires knowing what a member's feature *should* do. An assertion mismatch inside a member's own subject matter is the common shape. Repairing your way to green through one of these is precisely how a batch ships a change that does not do what its issue asked.

Escalate a semantic failure to a bounded member-tier agent with the failure evidence and the relevant handovers, and give it explicit permission to report that it cannot decide. That is cheap and it is reliably better than guessing.

**Repair, then VERIFY.** Re-run the affected member's own tests before you commit a repair. A repair is a change to code you did not write, against intent you inferred — it can regress the member. Applying a fix and moving on is how a "trivial" repair ships a defect.

Commit repairs as batch-level commits, attributable to no member.

**Bound the repair budget per member.** Exhausting it is the signal to evict, not to keep trying. Evicting means reverting that member's commits, re-running verification, and requeueing the issue with the failure evidence attached — the rest of the batch still ships.

### Step 5: Aggregate review

Review the combined diff for **cross-member interaction** — seams, duplicated helpers, conflicting assumptions between members. Per-issue acceptance criteria were already verified by each member's own conformance verdict; re-reviewing them here dilutes the pass over a large diff and finds less.

### Step 6: Ship one PR

Open a single PR closing every member issue that survived. **Merge with rebase, never squash** — per-issue commits carry the attribution eviction, revert, and bisect all depend on, and squashing destroys it.

The PR body should carry a section per member and name every batch-level repair with its cause.

**The PR's own CI is not redundant with your run.** It typically runs a different selection, in a clean environment, against its own infrastructure. It will catch things your run did not, and it is the trustworthy signal when your own run was degraded by contention. Your job is not finished when your local gate is green.

## Signal discipline — normative, not advisory

Everything you decide is read from an artifact. These rules exist because an actor who knew them still got each one wrong in practice:

1. **Liveness is proven, never inferred.** Track the process you launched, by the identity you captured at launch. A pattern match finds the wrong process — including, on a shared machine, somebody else's; and a pattern specific enough to name your target also matches your own command line.
2. **Completion requires an explicit terminal marker from the runner.** Output silence is not completion — a quiet log is often a long test running silently.
3. **A failure filter must match the runner's actual output.** Verify your filter matches something known-present before trusting a zero from it. A filter that finds nothing is indistinguishable from a condition that is not there.
4. **A non-zero exit code is a status, not necessarily an error.** Read the tool's contract.
5. **Absence of a result is not a result.** "0 tests ran" is a suite that never ran, not a pass. An empty capture is not a verdict.
6. **A result field named "success" is not a verdict.** Agent CLIs report a success-shaped subtype alongside an error flag. Read the error flag and the result text.
7. **Split every cost, duration and outcome statistic by outcome before quoting it.** A median over mixed populations inverts conclusions — fast failures masquerade as fast successes.
8. **Verify against what will ship, not your working tree.** A stack trace citing a line number your patch moved means the running code does not contain your patch.
9. **Never extrapolate progress linearly.** Verification stages are wildly uneven; one group can take an hour and the next a minute.

## Success Criteria

- Every surviving member merged, with per-issue commits intact
- The repo's expensive verification run **once** for the batch, not once per member
- No member evicted on an `automation-broken` signal
- Every repair verified against the affected member's own tests before commit
- One PR, rebase-merged, closing every surviving member issue
- Evicted members requeued with their failure evidence; the batch ships what survived
