# Hello World Dossier

This is a sample dossier to demonstrate the basic structure and format.

## Purpose

Use this dossier as a template when creating new dossiers for the registry.

## Instructions

1. Copy this file as a starting point
2. Update the frontmatter with your dossier's metadata
3. Replace this content with your actual dossier content
4. Add to `index.json` manifest
5. Commit and push to the content repository

## Example Usage

```bash
dossier pull getting-started/hello
```

## Notes

- Dossiers use YAML frontmatter for metadata
- The `name` in `index.json` should match the file path (without `.ds.md`)
- Keep dossiers focused on a single topic or task
